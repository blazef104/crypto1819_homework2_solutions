\[
    \H \text{ is CRHF } \Rightarrow \H \text{ is OWF}
\]
To show this property, let's make a reduction:
\begin{figure}[h!]
   \centering
   \sdinit{}
   \begin{tikzpicture}
      \sdbegin{}
      \newinst{A}{$ \A'^{OWF} $}
      \newinst[4]{B}{$ \A $}
      \newinst[4]{C}{$\C^{CRHF}$}

      \postlevel
      \mess{C}{$s$}{B}
      \node[anchor=west] at (mess from) {\shortstack[l]{
      		$  s \leftarrow\$ \{0,1\}^{\lambda} 
      		  $ 
            \\
            $    $ }};
      \postlevel
      \mess{B}{$s, y=H_{s}(x)$}{A}
      \node[anchor=west] at (mess from) {\shortstack[l]{
      		$  x \leftarrow\$ \{0,1\}^{2n} 
      		  $ 
             }};
      \postlevel
      \mess{A}{$x'$}{B}
      \node[anchor=west] at (mess to) {  };
      \postlevel
      \mess{B}{$x, x'$}{C}
      \node[anchor=west] at (mess to) {  };


      \sdend{}
      \sdend{}
   \end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}

When does not $\A$ win?\\
Since CRHF game  wants the final couple $(x, x')$ with $x\not= x'$, if
$\A'^{OWF}$ returns $x'=x$ the CRHF game doesn't work.\\

This \textbf{BAD} event happens with 
\[
    \P [ x=x' ]=Col(X, X')=\sum_{x}^{} \P [ X=x \wedge X'=x ]= \sum_{x}^{} \P [X=x] \P [ X'=x ] = \frac{1}{2^{2n}}        
\].

\subsection{ii}%

Intuitively if the function is not compressing ($h:n \to n$) and is collision resistant we can take the best hash function possible (a bijective one). In this case the function will obviously be CRHF since it is impossible to find $x\neq x'$ s.t. $h(x)=h(x')$, however this will not be one way since there will be a unique correspondence between an element in the domain and an element in the codomain so given a 1 to 1 mapping should be easy to go from an element to another.

\notodo{If functions from $\H$ family aren't compressing, the probability of
\textbf{BAD} event changes:
\[
    \P [ x=x' ]=Col(X, X')=\sum_{x}^{} \P [ X=x \wedge X'=x ]= \sum_{x}^{} \P [X=x] \P [ X'=x ] = \frac{1}{2^{n}}        
\].

Now, if our functions from $\H$ were compressing (from 2n bits to n bits), the
best CRHF function (the function with the minimum number of collisions) had
$2^{n} + 1 $ inputs generating a collision (in the same codomain's element).\\

In this case, the best possible CRHF function is bijective (since it could be a permutation over $2^{n}$ elements).\\

In general, for non-compressing functions we can show that 
\[
    \H \text{ is CRHF mapping n bits to n bits}  \Rightarrow \H \text{ is OWF}
\]

with the same reduction of the above \textbf{point i} .

\section{point b}

Given $H_{s_1,s_2}^*(x)=H_{s_2}'(H_{s_1}(x))$ with $H^*:4n \rightarrow n$.
Suppose $\exists A^{H^*}$ which is able to find a collision in $H^*$.

Consider the following two Games:
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \sdinit{}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.8]
       \sdbegin{}
       \newinst{A}{$ \A^{H^*} $}
       \newinst[4]{B}{$ \A $}
       \newinst[4]{C}{$\C^{H'}$}
 
       \postlevel
       \mess{A}{$x$}{B}
       \postlevel
       \mess{B}{$x'$}{C}
       \node[anchor=east] at (mess from) { $x'=H_{s_1}(x)$ };
       \postlevel

       \mess{C}{$y$}{B}
       \node[anchor=west] at (mess from) { $y=H'_{s_2}(x')$ };
       \mess{B}{$y$}{A}
       \postlevel

       \mess{A}{$x^*$}{B}
       \node[anchor=east] at (mess from) { \shortstack{$H^*(x^*)=y$\\and $x^*\neq x$} };
       \node[anchor=west] at (mess to) { \shortstack[l]{$H_{s_1}(x^*)$\\check$H_{s_1}(x^*)=x'$} };
       \postlevel
       \mess{B}{$x^*$}{C}
       \node[anchor=west] at (mess to) {  };
 
       \sdend{}
       \sdend{}
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}

There is a "BAD event" in which $A^{H^*}$ outputs a collision for $H_{s_1}$, meaning that $H_{s_1}(x)=H_{s_1}(x')$ in this case the second part of the reduction doesn't work. But $Pr[BAD]$ is negligible since $H_{s_1}$ is collision resistant by definition. But now $H^*(x')=H^*(x)$ since $x'$ was a collision for $H^*$ but this must be a collision also for $H'_{s_2}$ which was a CRHF for hypothesis.
