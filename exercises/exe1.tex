\section{point a}

Since PRP in \underline{by definition} computationally close to $U$ breaking CPA security implies to distinguish between the PRP and a uniform distribution.

\todo{Find a correct game}

\section{point b}

Let's construct a contrived PRP family in the following way:

$\forall k, P_k^{-1}(0) = 0^{n/2} || k$ this is still CPA since $A$ cannot do decryption queries however an adversary  playing a CCA game can query the decryption of $0$ and thus obtain the key.
